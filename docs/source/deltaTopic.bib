              research tool in single-cell genomics. With a topic model, we can
              decompose and ascertain distinctive cell topics shared across

              Here, we present a Bayesian topic model that can uncover
              short-term RNA velocity patterns from a plethora of spliced and
              unspliced single-cell RNA-seq counts. We showed that modelling
              both types of RNA counts can improve robustness in statistical
              estimation and reveal new aspects of dynamic changes that can be
              missed in static analysis. We showcase that our modelling
              framework can be used to identify statistically-significant
              dynamic gene programs in pancreatic cancer data. Our results
              discovered that seven dynamic gene programs (topics) are highly

              for evaluating pathway enrichment in transcriptional data.
              Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions
              with several replicates using a differential gene expression test
              followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of
              hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference
              implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small
              P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to
              multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present FGSEA
              (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to
              estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a
              matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the
              method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values

              algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely
              estimate P-values up to 10−100 with a small and predictable
              estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a
              collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more

              pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is largely unknown.
              Clinical trials targeting ER with selective estrogen receptor

              we analyze the impact of recently characterized ER isoform beta
              on survival in a cohort of patients with resected PDAC. METHODS:
              Eighty-four patients having undergone pancreatic resection for
              PDAC at a single institution were identified. Tissue microarrays
              were constructed of archival tumor specimens. The expression of
              ER beta was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantified by
              a system established for estrogen receptor expression in breast
              cancer. ER beta expression was then correlated with
              clinicopathological parameters, and univariate and multivariate
              survival analyses were performed. RESULTS: Nuclear expression of
              ER beta was found in 31\% of tumors. No significant correlation
              was found between ER beta expression and TNM status, tumor grade,
              age or sex. Univariate analysis revealed nodal metastasis and the
              expression of ER beta as factors correlating with a shorter
              overall survival and disease free survival. When comparing ER
              beta expression in patients surviving more than 24 months with
              those who died from the tumor within 12 or 24 months,
              respectively, a significantly lower ER beta expression was found
              in the long term survivors. In multivariate analysis, ER beta
              expression was demonstrated to be an independent predictor of
              shorter overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In resected PDAC,
              expression of ER beta seems to correlate with poor prognosis.
              These data may help to identify patients who may benefit from

              patients with pancreatic cancer. We recently discovered PRSS3 to
              be over-expressed in metastatic human pancreatic cancer cells.
              This study aimed to elucidate the role of PRSS3 in the growth and
              metastasis of human pancreatic cancer. METHODS: PRSS3 expression
              in human pancreatic cancer cell lines was detected by qPCR and
              immunoblotting. The effect of PRSS3 on cancer cell proliferation,
              migration and invasion in vitro, tumour growth and metastasis in
              vivo were investigated by manipulation of PRSS3 expression in
              human pancreatic cancer cell lines. VEGF expression was detected
              by ELISA, and the pathway through which PRSS3 regulates VEGF
              expression was investigated. The therapeutic effect of targeting
              this pathway on metastasis was assessed in vivo.
              Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect PRSS3 expression in
              human pancreatic cancer tissues. RESULTS: PRSS3 was
              over-expressed in the metastatic PaTu8988s cell line, but not in
              the non-metastatic PaTu8988t cell line. Over-expression of PRSS3
              promoted pancreatic cancer cell proliferation as well as invasion
              in vitro, and tumour progression and metastasis in vivo. Stepwise
              investigations demonstrated that PRSS3 upregulates VEGF
              expression via the PAR1-mediated ERK pathway. ERK inhibitor
              significantly delayed the progression of metastases of pancreatic
              cancer and prolonged the survival of animals bearing metastatic
              pancreatic cancer (p<0.05). 40.54\% of human pancreatic cancers
              (n=74) were positive for PRSS3 protein. A significant correlation
              was observed between PRSS3 expression and metastasis (p<0.01).
              Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that patients with
              PRSS3 expression in their tumours had a shorter survival time
              compared to those without PRSS3 expression (p<0.05). CONCLUSION:
              PRSS3 plays an important role in the progression, metastasis and
              prognosis of human pancreatic cancer. Targeting the PRSS3
              signalling pathway may be an effective and feasible approach for

              Strategies to prevent the development of PDAC are urgently
              required. The flavonoids Luteolin (Lut) and hesperetin (Hes) may
              be cancer-chemopreventive, but effects on pancreatic

              carcinogenesis are assessed in the BOP-induced hamster PDAC
              model. Lut but not Hes suppressed proliferation of pancreatic
              intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and reduced the incidence and
              multiplicity of PDAC in this model. Lut also inhibited the
              proliferation of hamster and human pancreatic cancer cells in
              vitro. Multi-blot and microarray assays revealed decreased
              phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
              (DPYD) on Lut exposure. To explore the relationship between DPYD
              and STAT3 activity, the former was silenced by RNAi or
              overexpressed using expression vectors, and the latter was
              inactivated by small molecule inhibitors or stimulated by IL6 in
              human PDAC cells. DPYD knock-down decreased, and overexpression
              increased, pSTAT3 and cell proliferation. DPYD expression was
              decreased by inactivation of STAT3 and increased by its
              activation. The frequency of pSTAT3-positive cells and DPYD
              expression was significantly correlated and was decreased in
              parallel by Lut in the hamster PDAC model. Finally,
              immunohistochemical analysis in 73 cases of human PDAC
              demonstrated that DPYD expression was positively correlated with
              the Ki-67 labeling index, and high expression was associated with
              poor prognosis. These results indicate that Lut is a promising
              chemopreventive agent for PDAC, targeting a novel STAT3-DPYD

	abstract = {The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is aberrantly stimulated in many
              cancer cells, has emerged as a target for therapy. However,
              mTORC1/S6K also mediates negative feedback loops that attenuate
              upstream signaling. Suppression of these feedback loops opposes
              the growth-suppressive effects of mTOR inhibitors and leads to
              drug resistance. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of PANC-1 or
              MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells with the
              dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor (PI3K/TOR-KI) BEZ235 blocked
              mTORC1/S6K activation (scored by S6 phosphorylation at
              Ser(240/244)), mTORC1/4E-BP1 (assayed by 4E-BP1 phosphorylation
              at Thr(37/46)), and mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation at
              Ser(473), in a concentration-dependent manner. Strikingly, BEZ235
              markedly enhanced the MEK/ERK pathway in a dose-dependent manner.
              Maximal ERK overactivation coincided with complete inhibition of
              phosphorylation of AKT and 4E-BP1. ERK overactivation was induced
              by other PI3K/TOR-KIs, including PKI-587 and GDC-0980. The MEK
              inhibitors U126 or PD0325901 prevented ERK overactivation induced
              by PI3K/TOR-KIs. The combination of BEZ235 and PD0325901 caused a
              more pronounced inhibition of cell growth than that produced by
              each inhibitor individually. Mechanistic studies assessing PI3K
              activity in single PDAC cells indicate that PI3K/TOR-KIs act
              through a PI3K-independent pathway. Doses of PI3K/TOR-KIs that
              enhanced MEK/ERK activation coincided with those that inhibited
              mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation on Ser(473), suggesting a
              role of mTORC2. Knockdown of RICTOR via transfection of siRNA
              markedly attenuated the enhancing effect of BEZ235 on ERK
              phosphorylation. We propose that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors

              Consequently, although PI3K suppression can attenuate immune
              responses it can also enhance inflammation, disrupt peripheral
              tolerance and promote autoimmunity. An exciting discovery is that
              a selective inhibitor of the p110$\delta$ catalytic isoform of
              PI3K, CAL-101, achieves impressive clinical efficacy in certain
              B-cell malignancies. A model is emerging in which p110$\delta$
              inhibition disrupts signals from the lymphoid microenvironment,
              leading to release of leukaemia and lymphoma cells from their
              protective niche. These encouraging findings have given further
              momentum to PI3K drug development efforts in both cancer and
              immune diseases.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will soon belong to the
              top three cancer killers. The only approved specific PDAC therapy
              targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although
              EGFR is a crucial player in PDAC development, EGFR-based therapy
              is disappointing. In this study, we evaluated the role of the
              EGFR ligand betacellulin (BTC) in PDAC. The expression of BTC was
              investigated in human pancreatic cancer specimen. Then, we
              generated a BTC knockout mouse model by CRISPR/Cas9 technology
              and a BTC overexpression model. Both models were crossed with the
              Ptf1aCre/+ ;KRASG12D/+ (KC) mouse model (B-/- KC or BKC,
              respectively). In addition, EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4 were
              investigated by the pancreas-specific deletion of each receptor
              using the Cre-loxP system. Tumor initiation and progression were
              analyzed in all mouse lines, and the underlying molecular biology
              of PDAC was investigated at different time points. BTC is
              expressed in human and murine PDAC. B-/- KC mice showed a
              decelerated PDAC progression, associated with decreased EGFR
              activation. BKC mice developed severe PDAC with a poor survival
              rate. The dramatically increased BTC-mediated tumor burden was
              EGFR-dependent, but also ERBB4 and ERBB2 were involved in PDAC
              development or progression, as depletion of EGFR, ERBB2, or ERBB4
              significantly improved the survival rate of BTC-mediated PDAC.
              BTC increases PDAC tumor burden dramatically by enhanced RAS
              activation. EGFR signaling, ERBB2 signaling, and ERBB4 signaling
              are involved in accelerated PDAC development mediated by BTC
              indicating that targeting the whole ERBB family, instead of a
              single receptor, is a promising strategy for the development of
              future PDAC therapies.},

              transcription factor 2), a key regulator of immune homeostasis in
              the chronicity of CP. METHODS: Expression of Bach2 and T-cell
              transcription factors, enumeration of BACH2+/CD4+ T-lymphocytes
              were performed by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively.
              Bach2silenced human CD4+ T-lymphocytes were exposed to CP tissue
              extract to assess T-cell lineage commitment. Aryl hydrocarbon
              receptor (Ahr) and Deubiquitinase enzyme A (DUBA/OTUD5gene) were
              evaluated as markers of persistent Th17 cell differentiation.
              Bach2 gene (exons) was sequenced to identify risk variants and
              functionally validated. RESULTS: Decrease in Bach2 (p < 0.0001)
              and increase (p < 0.001) in TBX21, RORC, Ahr, PRDM1, IL23R mRNA
              were noted in pancreatic tissues, while BACH2+/CD4+ T-lymphocytes
              were decreased (p < 0.01) in circulation and tissues. Exposure of
              Bach2 silenced CD4+ T-lymphocytes to CP tissue extract showed
              increased Ahr, decreased OTUD5, and enhanced Th17 cell

              Therefore, we set out to identify key signalling events that
              drive metastatic evolution from the pancreas. We searched for a
              gene signature that discriminate localised PDAC from confirmed
              metastatic PDAC and devised a preclinical protocol using

              signalling events. An unbiased approach identified, amongst

              immunity, presenting a mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy.
              In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, B cells can display a T
              cell-suppressive or regulatory phenotype centered on the
              expression of the cytokine Interleukin 35 (IL-35). While B
              cell-mediated immunosuppression presents a barrier to
              anti-tumorigenic T cell function, it is not clear how regulatory
              B cell function could be targeted, and the signals that promote
              this suppressive phenotype in B cells are not well understood.
              Here we use a novel IL-35 reporter model to understand which
              signaling pathways are important for immunosuppressive properties
              in B cells. In vitro analysis of IL-35 reporter B cells revealed
              a synergy between the BCR and TLR4 signaling pathways is
              sufficient to induce IL-35 expression. However, in vivo, B cell
              receptor activation, as opposed to MyD88 signaling in B cells, is
              central to B cell-mediated suppression and promotion of
              pancreatic cancer growth. Further analysis identified protein
              kinase D2 (PKD2) as being a key downstream regulator of IL-35
              expression in B cells. Regulatory B cells with an inactivating
              mutation in PKD2 failed to produce IL-35 or fully suppress

              in B cells decreased tumor growth and promoted effector T cell
              function upon adoptive transfer into B cell-deficient mice.

               approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This
               problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which
               frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation
               involving the posterior density. In this article, we review
               variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that
               approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has
               been used in many applications and tends to be faster than
               classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
               The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and
               then to find a member of that family which is close to the
               target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback?Leibler

               cannot be tracked longitudinally, and cells at the same point in
               real time may be at different stages of the transition process.
               This can be viewed as a problem of learning the behavior of a

               Additionally, a single progenitor cell type often bifurcates

              embeddings, topic embeddings, and batch-effect linear intercepts
              from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. scETM is scalable to over 106

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is most
              aggressive among all gastrointestinal tumors. The complex
              intra-tumor heterogeneity and special tumor microenvironment in
              PDAC bring great challenges for developing effective treatment
              strategies. We aimed to delineate dynamic changes of tumor
              microenvironment components during PDAC malignant progression
              utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing. METHODS: A total of 11
              samples (4 PDAC I, 4 PDAC II, 3 PDAC III) were used to construct
              expression matrix. After identifying distinct cell clusters,
              subcluster analysis for each cluster was performed. New cancer
              associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subset was validated by weighted
              gene co-expression network analysis, RNA in situ hybridization
              and immunofluorescence. FINDINGS: We found that ductal cells were
              not dominant component while tumor infiltrating immune cells and
              pancreatic stellate cells gradually accumulated during tumor
              development. We defined several new Treg and exhausted T cell
              signature genes, including DUSP4, FANK1 and LAIR2. The analysis
              of TCGA datasets showed that patients with high expression of
              DUSP4 had significantly worse prognosis. In addition, we
              identified a new CAFs subset (complement-secreting CAFs, csCAFs),
              which specifically expresses complement system components, and
              constructed csCAFs-related module by weighted gene co-expression
              network analysis. The csCAFs were located in the tissue stroma
              adjacent to malignant ductal cells only in early PDAC.
              INTERPRETATION: We systematically explored PDAC heterogeneity and
              identified csCAFs as a new CAFs subset special to PDAC, which may
              be valuable for understanding the crosstalk inside tumor.

              estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward
              to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory
              requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the
              gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in
              terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate
              for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or
              sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
              interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some
              connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired,
              are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence
              properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the

              ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as only a few markers have been
              routinely used so far with limited success. Our aim was to assess
              the expression of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally
              down-regulated protein 9 (NEDD9), E-cadherin, and
              $\gamma$-catenin in PDAC in relation to clinicopathological
              parameters and patient survival. We also investigated if there is
              a correlation of NEDD9 expression with E-cadherin or
              $\gamma$-catenin. The protein expression was determined by
              immunohistochemistry in 61 PDAC and 61 samples of normal
              pancreatic tissue. The log rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival
              curve were used for survival analysis. E-cadherin and
              $\gamma$-catenin expressions were reduced in PDAC, and completely
              retained in normal pancreatic tissue. Expression of NEDD9 was
              significantly increased in PDAC (strong expression in 78.7\% of
              cases and moderate in 21.3\%) and reduced in normal pancreatic
              tissue (strong positivity in 45.9\% of cases, moderate in 31.1\%,
              and weak in 23\%). There was a positive correlation between
              reduced E-cadherin and $\gamma$-catenin expression in PDAC (p =
              0.015). The loss or reduced expression of E-cadherin had a
              negative impact on patient survival (p = 0.020). A negative
              correlation between E-cadherin expression and tumor grade was
              also observed (p = 0.011). Decreased E-cadherin expression was
              more common in male patients with PDAC (81.3\% vs. 60\% for
              females, p = 0.005). $\gamma$-catenin and NEDD9 expressions were
              not statistically correlated with tumor stage and grade, gender,

	abstract = {The protein containing the C2 domain has been well documented for
              its essential roles in endocytosis, cellular metabolism and
              cancer. Tac2-N (TC2N) is a tandem C2 domain-containing protein,
              but its function, including its role in tumorigenesis, remains
              unknown. Here, we first identified TC2N as a novel oncogene in
              lung cancer. TC2N was preferentially upregulated in lung cancer
              tissues compared with adjacent normal lung tissues. High TC2N
              expression was significantly associated with poor outcome of lung
              cancer patients. Knockdown of TC2N markedly induces cell
              apoptosis and cell cycle arrest with repressing proliferation in
              vitro, and suppresses tumorigenicity in vivo, whereas
              overexpression of TC2N has the opposite effects both in vitro and
              in vivo. Using a combination of TCGA database and bioinformatics,
              we demonstrate that TC2N is involved in regulation of the p53
              signaling pathway. Mechanistically, TC2N attenuates p53 signaling
              pathway through inhibiting Cdk5-induced phosphorylation of p53
              via inducing Cdk5 degradation or disrupting the interaction
              between Cdk5 and p53. Moreover, the blockade of p53 attenuates
              the function of TC2N knockdown in the regulation of cell
              proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, downregulated TC2N is
              involved in the apoptosis of lung cancer cells induced by
              doxorubicin, leading to p53 pathway activation. Overall, these
              findings uncover a role for the p53 inactivator TC2N in
              regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of lung cancer cells.

              prognosis, but clinically available markers have not yet been
              identified. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the
              expression of B2M and ALK7 in 106 PDACs compared to precursor
              lesions of the pancreas. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used
              to detect B2M and ALK7 protein expression. RESULTS: Positive B2M
              expression was significantly higher, while positive expression of
              ALK7 was significantly lower in PDAC than in precursor lesions (p
              < 0.01 or p < 0.001). Positive B2M expression was also
              significantly higher, while positive ALK7 expression was
              significantly lower in cases with well-differentiated
              adenocarcinoma, small tumor mass, no-metastasis of the lymph
              node, no-invasion of regional tissues, and TNM I or II stage
              disease than in cases having poorly-differentiated
              adenocarcinoma, large tumor mass, with metastasis and invasion,
              and TNM stage III or IV stage disease (p < 0.01). Univariate
              Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that B2M overexpression (p < 0.001),
              but lack of ALK7 expression (p < 0.001) was significantly
              associated with shorter overall survival. Cox multivariate
              analysis showed that differentiation, tumor mass, lymph node
              metastasis, invasion, TNM stage, and B2M levels negatively
              correlated with overall survival. In contrast, ALK7 level
              positively correlated with overall survival. Positive B2M and
              negative ALK7 expression are poor prognostic factors in PDAC
              patients. CONCLUSIONS: B2M and ALK7 might be important biological
              markers involved in the carcinogenesis, metastasis, invasion, and
              prognosis of PDAC.},

              membership in multiple clusters. These models are widely used in
              population genetics to model admixed individuals who have
              ancestry from multiple ``populations'', and in natural language
              processing to model documents having words from multiple
              ``topics''. Here we illustrate the potential for these models to
              cluster samples of RNA-seq gene expression data, measured on
              either bulk samples or single cells. We also provide methods to
              help interpret the clusters, by identifying genes that are
              distinctively expressed in each cluster. By applying these
              methods to several example RNA-seq applications we demonstrate
              their utility in identifying and summarizing structure and
              heterogeneity. Applied to data from the GTEx project on 53 human
              tissues, the approach highlights similarities among
              biologically-related tissues and identifies
              distinctively-expressed genes that recapitulate known biology.
              Applied to single-cell expression data from mouse preimplantation
              embryos, the approach highlights both discrete and continuous
              variation through early embryonic development stages, and
              highlights genes involved in a variety of relevant processes-from
              germ cell development, through compaction and morula formation,
              to the formation of inner cell mass and trophoblast at the
              blastocyst stage. The methods are implemented in the Bioconductor
              package CountClust.},

              arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays,
              microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability
              to integrate information across platforms provided key insights
              into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated
              the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining
              data from five platforms, each of which shows significant
              molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes
              (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10\% incidence across all
              breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated
              and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific
              mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype.
              We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups,
              possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and
              integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways
              dominant in each molecular subtype including a
              HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature
              within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of
              basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours
              showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related
              aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological
              finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by
              different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises
              the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity
              and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major
              biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

@article{Kopf2019-nr,
	abstract = {Clustering high-dimensional data, such as images or
                   biological measurements, is a long-standing problem and has
                   been studied extensively. Recently, Deep Clustering gained
                   popularity due to the non-linearity of neural networks,
                   which allows for flexibility in fitting the specific
                   peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the
                   Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder
                   (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The
                   model can learn multi-modal distributions of
                   high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic
                   data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based
                   on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder
                   consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This
                   specific architecture allows for various modes of the data
                   to be automatically learned by means of the experts.
                   Additionally, we encourage the latent representation of our
                   model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to
                   accurately represent the similarities between the data
                   points. We assess the performance of our model on synthetic
                   data, the MNIST benchmark data set, and a challenging
                   real-world task of defining cell subpopulations from mass
                   cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different
                   datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering
                   performance on all these tasks in comparison to the
                   baselines and we show that the MoE architecture in the
                   decoder reduces the computational cost of sampling specific
                   data modes with high fidelity.},

@article{Anglesio2017-ik,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endometriosis, defined as the presence of ectopic
              endometrial stroma and epithelium, affects approximately 10\% of
              reproductive-age women and can cause pelvic pain and infertility.
              Endometriotic lesions are considered to be benign inflammatory
              lesions but have cancerlike features such as local invasion and
              resistance to apoptosis. METHODS: We analyzed deeply infiltrating
              endometriotic lesions from 27 patients by means of exomewide
              sequencing (24 patients) or cancer-driver targeted sequencing (3
              patients). Mutations were validated with the use of digital
              genomic methods in microdissected epithelium and stroma.
              Epithelial and stromal components of lesions from an additional
              12 patients were analyzed by means of a droplet digital
              polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay for recurrent activating
              KRAS mutations. RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed somatic
              mutations in 19 of 24 patients (79\%). Five patients harbored
              known cancer driver mutations in ARID1A, PIK3CA, KRAS, or
              PPP2R1A, which were validated by Safe-Sequencing System or
              immunohistochemical analysis. The likelihood of driver genes
              being affected at this rate in the absence of selection was
              estimated at P=0.001 (binomial test). Targeted sequencing and a
              droplet digital PCR assay identified KRAS mutations in 2 of 3
              patients and 3 of 12 patients, respectively, with mutations in
              the epithelium but not the stroma. One patient harbored two
              different KRAS mutations, c.35G$\rightarrow$T and
              c.35G$\rightarrow$C, and another carried identical KRAS
              c.35G$\rightarrow$A mutations in three distinct lesions.
              CONCLUSIONS: We found that lesions in deep infiltrating
              endometriosis, which are associated with virtually no risk of
              malignant transformation, harbor somatic cancer driver mutations.
              Ten of 39 deep infiltrating lesions (26\%) carried driver
              mutations; all the tested somatic mutations appeared to be
              confined to the epithelial compartment of endometriotic lesions.},

@article{Shah2012-ng,
	abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type
              defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and
              ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16\% of all
              breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time
              of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum
              of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding
              somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain
              hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA
              sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36\% of
              mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of
              allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for
              the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype,
              the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases
              representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely
              in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the
              basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC.
              Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic
              mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes,
              in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with
              founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and
              motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies,
              suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression.
              Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology
              and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the
              determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},
